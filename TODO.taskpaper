Feature:
	- Add platform specific locations, so the same file can wind up in different locations depending on platform
		Maybe file with mappings named mapping.json
			{
				file: {
					name: "test.txt",
					targets: {
						window: "%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json",
						mac: "Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json"
					}
				}
			}
		what this does is copy name to location of each target
