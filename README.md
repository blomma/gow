# viaduct

Coding up this was less of a choir and more fun than getting stow to work on windows.

It works exactly like stow, except more basic. It only creates relative softlinks and it has only rudimentary error checking, sort of...
So use at own risk. But it works for me. And more importantly it works across MacOS, Windows and Linux, and in the end
isn't that what we all want. Universal love.
